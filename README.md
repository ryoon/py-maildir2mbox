# Port maildir2mbox.py to Python 3.10

Originally from `https://gist.github.com/nyergler/1709069`.

## Dependency
No external Python module is required to run.
This uses Python standard library only.

## License
The original Python script is released in public domain.
So my changes are also trivial and this script is still
in public domain.
